The purpose of this short exercise is to make sure you understand what we talked about before about data types in python

Refer to this infographic for a list of data types and examples. https://i.pinimg.com/originals/9b/39/47/9b3947aeeabd96ee3c9d4f85c323e9e2.jpg

P.S. I know the information im providing is sparse. The intention of the exercise is for you to read online and learn as much as you can yourself (without taking a class) and to ask me questions as much as you want.
You dont truly understand something if you cant talk to someone about it, so talk to me about it and it will definitely help you understand things better!

the important types to use right now are integers, floats, strings, lists, and dicts. you can ignore everything else for right now.

Good programmers spend a lot of time reading documentation online. This is the official python documentation, use at will: https://docs.python.org/3/

Another good site to use as a beginner is geeks for geeks, but stay off of stackoverflow for now.

For your first program, implement this https://i.pinimg.com/736x/80/0e/fe/800efe79e72d1bb233bfe24cede5d66f.jpg !!

This is a simple state machine to help you practice writing conditional statements and controlling the flow of the program.
You will probably have questions, dont be afraid to ask them.

Here is an example of the User Experience that your program should produce something similar to this.

############################################################
## Which Powerpuff girl are you most like? Find out now!! ##
############################################################

Choose 1 or 2 for each question.
Lets start:
Your BFFs would say you're [ (1) Confident or (2) Fearless ]
Your response > 1
You chose confident! Next question...

Help - a villian is destroying the city! You [ (1) Start by coming up with a plan! or (2) Have already smashed their kneecaps. Next? ]
Your response > 1
You chose Start by coming up with a plan!!


You're * BLOSSOM * which means YOU'RE A LEADER.
Every girl squad needs someone in charge - and for your group of.......on the fly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is some example code to help you get started

print("Your BFFs would say you're [ (1) Confident or (2) Fearless ]")
response = input("Your response > ")
if int(response) == 1:
    print("You chose confident! \n\r")
    print("Help - a villian is destroying the city! You [ (1) Start by coming up with a plan! or (2) Have already smashed their kneecaps. Next? ]")
    response = input("Your response > ")
    if int(response) == 1:
        print("You chose Start by coming up with a plan!")
        print("You're BLOSSOM.......")
        exit(0)
    elif int(response) == 2:
        print("You chose...")
elif int(response) == 2:
    print("you chose Fearless")
    ...
else:
    print("You submitted an invalid response, exiting...")
    exit(1)
